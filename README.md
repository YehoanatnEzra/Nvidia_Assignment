# TODO:

## Testing in my program:
### input:
* decide what to do if the folder path or the event_file path is invalid
*  Check if the time stamp is valid (12 months, and number of the days are correclt. maybe I should check how many days exist each month)
* Check if "from "timestamp" is indeed before "to timestamp"
* check if "from timestamp" and "from timestamp" is indeed a valid and reasonable time (not somthing in the future or before 100 year (constant invalid year)
*
